# Process
Step 1: Obtaining data
This dataset is from
[weather Dataset](https://www.)

Step 2: Loading and understanding the dataset.
- Working with Weather.csv data to understand  each feature in the dataset.
- Having a general understanding and information about the relationship between various features .

Step 3: Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing 
- clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers.
- Create a displot, histplot,Densityplot, scatterplot and pairplot to look at the distributions of different variables and their correlation.
- summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for each column of the dataset. 
- Learn the trend and detect outlier or possible factor that can affect the data output.
- Create heatmap to take a closer look at the corellation.
- Detect and handle outliers.
- Structure the data for efficient analysis.
- Split the into training and testing for appropriate training .
- Scale the data 

Step 4:  Model: Ridge regression, Decision tree,Randomforest Regressor, GradientBoostingRegressor,Time series
step 5: Model evaluation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (R2)
-
